# SPAM-SMS-Classifier

## Overview
Spam SMS Classifier is a Python-based machine learning project designed to classify SMS messages as spam or non-spam (ham). This project employs various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to accurately classify incoming text messages.

## Features
- Preprocessing techniques including tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal.
- Implementation of machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Deep Learning models like LSTM.
- Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Command-line interface for easy interaction and testing.
